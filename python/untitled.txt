Looping cheat sheet
Hereâ€™s a very short looping cheat sheet that might help you remember the preferred construct for each of these three looping scenarios.

Loop over a single list with a regular for-in:

for n in numbers:
    print(n)
Loop over multiple lists at the same time with zip:

for header, rows in zip(headers, columns):
    print("{}: {}".format(header, ", ".join(rows)))
Loop over a list while keeping track of indexes with enumerate:

for num, line in enumerate(lines):
    print("{0:03d}: {}".format(num, line))
